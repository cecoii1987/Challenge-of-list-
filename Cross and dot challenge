cross

The cross tool returns the cross product of two arrays.

Task

You are given two arrays A and B. Both have dimensions of NXM.
Your task is to compute their matrix product.

Input Format

The first line contains the integer N.
The next N lines contains N space separated integers of array A.
The following N lines contains N space separated integers of array B.

import numpy


N = int(input())
A = numpy.array([input().split() for i in range(N)], int)
B = numpy.array([input().split() for i in range(N)], int)
print(numpy.dot(A, B))
